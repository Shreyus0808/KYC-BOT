# KYC BOT
by LightHouse Labs

## Introduction:

KYC Bot presents a modern solution to the age-old challenge faced by banks: streamlining the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this tool leverages technology to simplify the verification of customer identities, benefiting both banks and customers alike.

## How it Works:

Using KYC Bot is very simple. First, the bot retrieves essential details such as names and addresses from Aadhar cards, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Next, users are prompted to show their Aadhar card to a webcam, where the bot captures a photo with a single click. The captured image is then analyzed against the bank's existing records. If the information matches, verification is swiftly confirmed, providing a seamless experience for users and reducing manual effort for bank staff.

## What it Aims to Solve:

KYC Bot addresses the inefficiencies and challenges associated with traditional KYC processes. By automating the verification process and reducing manual data entry, it aims to save time and resources for both banks and customers. Additionally, by enhancing accuracy and reliability through advanced technology, KYC Bot helps mitigate errors and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Overall, KYC Bot aims to revolutionize the KYC process, making it simpler, faster, and more convenient for all parties involved.
